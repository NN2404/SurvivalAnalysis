Survival analysis is the phrase used to describe the analysis of data in the form of times from a well-defined time origin until the 
occurrence of some particular event or end point. The time origin refers to the time in which an individual enters an experimental 
study EG.A clinical trial comparing 2 treatments. This time maybe measured in days, months or years depending on the experiment. 
The event might refer to the death of a patient, then the recorded data is literally survival times, 
but the event isnâ€™t limited to the death of a patient. In some cases it might refer to the recurrence of symptoms or in
the case of motor vehicles it might refer to the length of time a particular component will last.
